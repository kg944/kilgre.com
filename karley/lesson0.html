      <h1>Lesson 0: Introductions</h1>
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>In my opinion you should start with JavaScript, as you can start using it to make a website pretty easily, and eventually we could start making some simple games with it. In addition it is pretty simple to understand, and though it has some weird quirks, it is generally similar in structure to most other programming languages.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python: a scripting language,useful for learning programming, machine learning applications, scripts, etc. Not very fast, and for this reason isn't typically used to make big programs like games, websites, etc.</li>
        <li>JavaScript: the main programming langauge of websites. All browsers support and understand it, and it is used to do all the 'logic' in websites like handle clicking actions, displaying graphics, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <h3>General</h3>
      <p>
      The first step we want to take is to download an <b>editor</b>. This is what we will use to actually write the code- this is what you were writing and running the code in on my laptop. The on I and many other developers use is VSCode. You can download it for free online, and should be able to run it without trouble after download. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Here is the link.</a>
      </p>
      <p>After downloading and opening VSCode, you will be prompted to open a new folder or something I don't know but either way just make a new folder wherever you want. Name it something like "programming" or "python_learning" or whatever you want; we can organize into lesson folders or something better later but for now lets just get started.</p>
      <h3>Python</h3>
      <p>To get started with python, download it from the link you find online. I think you already did this. After that you will probably need to follow some steps to get it in the windows path so it can be run from the command prompt like we were doing Sunday. There should be instructions to do this if it doesn't work, but it will probably be easier to debug this over a discord call if you haven't already gotten it working rather than trying to write those steps here.</p>
      <p>Once you <i>have</i> been able to successfully install python, you should be able to make a new file and run it just like we did in the coffee shop. Try this by making a new file in VSCode (file new, name it something like hello.py), write "print("hello")" and save. Then open a terminal instance with Ctrl + `, and write python hello.py or python3 hello.py. This should run the file and print hello. If it does, congrats! We can now write python, and you can move on to Lesson 1. If not text me or something</p>
      <h3>JavaScript</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is easy to access and use, but is a bit different than Python in terms of running files or writing programs. For example, go to any browser and press F12 - you will open up the developer console, and if you click the tab that says "console" (if you aren't already on it) then the resulting window that you are focused on will just be a javascript shell. Go ahead and try some code, for example "x = 5" will set variable x to 5. Printing looks a little different, but try it out with "console.log(x)": this should print 5.</p>
      <p>Eventually I will either set up a simple website (much like this one!) for you to write some code (JavaScript, and HTML/CSS if you're feeling it) and test locally, but for now we can stick with Python to learn the basics. We can also try p5js, which is what I used to make that Mandalorian game a while ago and has some nice graphics libraries we can take advantage of.</p>
